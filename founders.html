                    <p>
                    <p>
                        Generally, in the 3rd year of college folks end up doing one of the following – Preparation for CAT (we missed IIT but we’re made for IIMs :)), effort to “build a strong resume” (for a job with a management consulting firm straight out) or the evergreen “Suppli todni hai”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Siddharth (Sid), Yogesh (Yogi) and I fell in the first and second category (as you can see we had ambitions then). So we decided to open a start-up which designed logos / brochures / marketing pitches for companies. So, after initial hiccups we were able to do decent work with sizable firms. When we socialized our work within the campus, it created quite a buzz. That time the DSLR boom was just starting and people always had questions about what camera to buy, what forums to read, how to edit pictures etc., which Sid and Yogi were more than willing to answer - especially if it came from the ladies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Somewhere along the line we realized that our college never really had a non-academic club that students can be a part of, even if they were not active members. Something that is not for certificates but for fun. With all the gadgetry around, the natural choice was photography. That is how sometime in August 2010 we set out to follow our vision of setting up this club, and Lumiere was born (we googled what “light” means in multiple languages and the French version resonated).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The road ahead was arduous for the club to see the light of day (a special shout out to Amit Dhamija Sir for helping us navigate a lot of turbulence). We had to seek a lot of permissions and had to have a minimum headcount of students who were interested in the idea. That is where the brochure genius of Yogi helped us in creating some marketing material within the campus. We had requested entries from students who wanted to learn more about basics of photography, what camera / lens to buy, basics of editing etc. in the first information session for the club. On the day of registration, lo and behold, we had around 250 requests from students who wanted to be a part of the group. Yes, 250. Not a typo!! Our job turned suddenly from finding enough people to deciding who to accept. That’s when, for the first time in our lives, we became recruiters and cut the group to around 45 students who we felt had the most inclination towards photography. For the rest, we assured everyone that we will hold events, photo walks and create a Facebook page where everyone could chip in with his / her photos (we achieved all these goals!!). Also, our club had an open door policy. If there was a session going on, we made sure that anyone who wanted to attend the event had access to it (of course attendance was not given).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After this process we were sharply aware of our responsibility to create a sustainable model for the club. A model that would transcend multiple batches. We felt that this would be our legacy, however small it was, it was “our thing” and we had to make sure it survives the test of time. To do this we started off by holding sessions where we discussed in details the intricacies of photography, best practices, we even invited Canon to give a session on photography – they were happy to oblige.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next step was to sell the idea to the whole college fraternity – students, teachers & management. That is how “Kliek” came into existence (Thanks to google for the name, again!!). We were permitted to host a photo exhibition where we wanted to showcase photographs from our members, non-members, other colleges in the NCR and some famous photographers. Next step was to raise money. We basically raised money from everywhere, our college - who were generous enough to lend money seeing the potential in the idea, Canon chipped in and Bobo corner uncle helped us too (not sure if that cart is still around). Additional money was raised when we had a photo booth with different props during the exhibition, where people paid us for wacky photos with interesting wigs, boards, hats etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cutting to the chase, we were able to hold an exhibition with a footfall of around 600 students from multiple colleges who competed across three different themes for cash prizes. We created multiple cardboard backgrounds where we showcased photos from a particular theme and the Registrar was kind enough to inaugurate the event. I think, that is when we realized that we have done our little bit in leaving a small impact in NCU and that it was time to pass the baton to the next batch of folks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe I speak for the three of us when I say the following - from that Spring of March 2011 to the summer of 2016, we are heartened to see that the 7th edition of Kliek is being held this year. We would like to thank the management and every volunteer of Lumiere who have done much more work than we did to make Lumiere a five-star club at NCU. I personally believe in giving back to the place you come from, whether you like it or not, it’s yours forever. Therefore, each and every one of you should feel proud about your contribution to the club and to the college. In our own way you tried to make a positive difference and that is all that matters.
                    </p>
                    Wishing all of you and Lumiere the greatest of heights – LIVE LONG & PROSPER
                    <p>
                        Cheers!
                    <p>
